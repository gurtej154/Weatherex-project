# Weatherex - Weather Dashboard Project

## Description 
Welcome to the Weatherex, a weather webapp that displays your locations weather instantaneously. Through the utilization of the OpenWeather API, this webapp displays accurate information of the selected location’s weather and a future forecast of 7-days to allow the user a comprehensive understanding of their location’s climate. 

With a sleek and modern User Interface, this webapp allows the user to navigate throughout it without hinderances or issues. 

The webapp is designed to ask the user to allow the webapp to automatically analyze the location without any search input entered, however if there are limitations in the function, the webapp than asks the user to input their location into search bar and manually acquire the weather forecast.
